-fix possibility of double occurences of area names
-complete ratio-redux. connect to ratio of showcase-container (later resizable component).
		-create little handlers on the top and on the left side of the layouting tool where users can select the 
		 viewpoint rectangle
		-according to this rectangle, count number of columns and rows. This makes it easy to use percentages
			example: 10 columns = 100vw, total columns 10 --> grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 10%);
				 8 rows = 100vh, total rows 20 --> grid-template-columns: repeat(20, 100/8 %);
-style grid that includes layout-tool and show-component with normal css (50%-50% for large screens, 100%-100% 
 for small screens)
	-use clienBoundingRect to calculate number of squares in layout tool
		(set number of pixels per square and then calculate how many pixels fit there)
	-rerender on screen resize
